# Welcome!

This is a simple **YOLO** object detection model demonstraion.

If you want to create your own YOLO object detection model with your own dataset, make sure you run this first, which will be extremely beneficial in order to understand how YOLO works.
This is a pretrained model which has been trained on the very famous, COCO dataset. 

### Disclaimer
The following steps are made based on the assumption that you are a absolute beginner with very little knowledge of python. (There is nothing wrong in jumping into projects before knowing the complete theory)

## Lets get started !

Step 1 : Open Pycharm and create a new project with a new virtual environment. (For your convinience, do this in a seperate folder). <br>
Step 2 : Download the two file provided in the repo, **requirements.txt** and **realwebcam.py** in the folder. <br>
Step 3 : Install the required modules and libraries as mentioned in the requirements.txt file. (You might see an option saying "install requirements.txt" just above the code block, Or you can simply type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal <br>
Step 4 : Run realwebcam.py file

Please go through the webcam python file for a better understanding
